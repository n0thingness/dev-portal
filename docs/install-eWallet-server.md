## Overview
This guide describes how to install the eWallet Server:

* Quick install on macOS and Linux; or, 
* Bare metal setup (advanced install on other platforms)

## Install


### Quick install on macOS or Linux
The quickest way to get OmiseGO eWallet Server running on macOS and Linux is to use Docker-Compose.

**Perform these steps:**

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. Download OmiseGO eWallet Server's [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omisego/ewallet/master/docker-compose.yml):
    ```
    curl -O -sSL
    ```

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omisego/ewallet/master/docker-compose.yml

3. Create docker-compose.override.yml, either manually, or use this auto-configuration script:
    ```
    curl -O -sSL
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omisego/ewallet/master/docker-gen.shchmod +x docker-gen.sh./docker-gen.sh > docker-compose.override.yml


4. Initialize the database and start the server:
    ```
    docker-compose run --rm ewallet initdb
    docker-compose run --rm ewallet seed
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Bare metal setup
This section provides advanced instructions for installing the eWallet server on a base operating system, on platforms other than macOS or Linux.  

A bare metal setup involves these tasks:

1. Prepare the environment
2. Set up the server.
3. Seed the database.
4. Start the server.


#### Step 1: Prepare the environment
To run this install, you'll need the following applications installed and running on your machine before you can set up the server:

> Using macOS? You can [install these dependencies via Homebrew](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/blob/master/docs/setup/macos/brew_install_dependencies.md).

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - used for storing most of the data for the eWallet and LocalLedger.

* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) - used for formatting images in the Admin Panel. Tested with version> 7.0.7-22.

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) - used as the primary language for the server components of the eWallet.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used for downloading and synchronizing codebase with the remote code repository.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - used for building front-end code for the Admin Panel.
 



#### Step 2: Set up the server
Perform these steps to set up the server:  

1. Get the code. Pull the eWallet code from the OmiseGO eWallet Git repository to      a directory of your choice:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/omisego/ewallet && cd ./ewallet
    ```

2. Install code dependencies:

    2.1 Fetch Elixir dependencies:
        ```
        $ mix deps.get
        ```

    2.2 Install front-end dependencies:
    ```
    $ (cd apps/frontend/assets/ && npm install)
    ```

    > **Note**: *Parentheses in the code above forces the commands to be executed in a subshell, and returns to the current working directory after the execution.*

3. Configure environment variables:
    
    Some configurations have predefined default values. 
    
    If your environment requires different values; then, run the following to set environment variables in the current session (or to add the settings to any profile you're using): 

    run `export ENV=value`

    | Environment variable  |   Description |
    |   ---                 |   ---         |
    |   PORT                |   The internal listening port for the application. Defaults to 4000   |
    | DATABASE_URL          | The URL where the eWallet database can be accessed. Defaults to postgres://localhost/ewallet_dev  |
    |   LOCAL_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL   | The URL where the Local Ledger database can be accessed. Defaults to postgres://localhost/local_ledger_dev    |

    > **Note:** *For more information about all the environment variables, see Environment Variables.*

4. Migrate the database: 

    4.1 Run the following command to set up the databases:   
    `$ mix do ecto.create, ecto.migrate`

    4.2 Run the following command to set up the test database, which is used to run the tests: 
    `$ MIX_ENV=test mix do ecto.create, ecto.migrate`


5. Run the following command to run the tests:  
    `$ mix test`
    
    This will ensure your setup is working properly.


#### Step 3: Seed the database
Some initial data is required to start the server. Either run the seed or the sample seed below:

1. Option A: Run this command to set up the initial data:
    `$ mix seed`

2. Option B: Run this command to set up the initial data and populate the database with more sample data:
    `$ mix seed --sample`ÃŸ


#### Step 4: Start the server
1. Use the following command to start the server: 
    `$ mix omg.server`

2. View confirmation output:
    ```
    [info] Setting up websockets dispatchers...
    [info] Running UrlDispatcher.Plug with Cowboy http on port 4000
    ```

3. Access the eWallet server using the available APIs:
    ```
    $ curl http://localhost:4000
    {"status": true}
    ```
    

4. Read the documentation to learn how to use your eWallet!

## Create and update the database
Docker image entrypoint is configured to recognize most commands used during normal operations. The way to invoke these commands depend on the installation method used: 

| Install method    | Instruction   |
|   ---             |   ---         |
|   Docker-Compose  |   Run `docker-compose run --rm ewallet`   |
|   Docker         |   Run  `-it --rm omisego/ewallet`         |
|   Bare metal   |   See install instructions for the bare metal setup   |




### initdb
These commands create or upgrade the database, as required. You'll need to run these commands each time you upgrade the version of the OmiseGO eWallet Suite.

* Docker-Compose: `docker-compose run --rm ewallet initdb`
* Docker: `docker run -it --rm omisego/ewallet:latest initdb`


### seed
These commands create the initial data in the database. If seed is run without arguments, the command will seed initial data for production environment. For example:

* Docker-Compose: `docker-compose run --rm ewallet seed` 
* Docker: `docker run -it --rm omisego/ewallet:latest seed` 
 
 The seed command may be configured to seed with other kind of seed data:

* To seed sample data suitable for evaluating OmiseGO eWallet:
    `seed --sample`
* To seed data for end-to-end testing:
    `seed --e2e`
* To seed the application settings for the OmiseGO eWallet Server:
    `seed --settings` 

> See also https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/blob/master/docs/setup/advanced/env.md

### config
These commands update the configuration key in the database.

> See also: https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/blob/master/docs/setup/advanced/settings.md

For keys requiring whitespace, such as gcs_credentials, you can prevent string splitting by putting them in a single or double-quote, e.g. config gcs_credentials "gcs configuration".

**Example:**

* Docker-Compose: `docker-compose run --rm ewallet config` <key> <value>
* Docker: `docker run -it --rm omisego/ewallet:latest config` <key> <value>


> Detailed documentation may be found in the [GitHub docs directory](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/tree/master/docs). It is recommended that you review the documentation for the OmiseGO eWallet Server you're running.

## Setup Troubleshooting Guide

### "invalid url ... path should be a database name"

**Problem:**

    ```elixir
    (Mix) Could not start application ewallet_db: EWalletDB.Application.start(:normal, []) returned an error: shutdown: failed to start child: EWalletDB.Repo
    (EXIT) an exception was raised: (Ecto.InvalidURLError) invalid url http://localhost, path should be a database name
    ```

**Solution**

The eWallet cannot connect to the database. Ensure you're using a valid URL, which would include the database protocol, e.g. `postgres://` and should point to the address where your database resides, as well as the database name. 
For example:

    ```bash
    export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/ewallet_dev
    export LOCAL_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/local_ledger_dev
    ```

The above set valid URLs to the environment variables, which point the eWallet to the `postgres` databases at `localhost` with the database names `ewallet_dev` and `local_ledger_dev`.
***

### "Connect raised a KeyError error ... exception details are hidden ..."

**Problem:**

    ```elixir
    (Mix) The database for LocalLedgerDB.Repo couldn't be created: an exception was raised:
    ** (RuntimeError) Connect raised a KeyError error. The exception details are hidden, as they may contain sensitive data such as database credentials.
    (elixir) lib/keyword.ex:386: Keyword.fetch!/2
    (postgrex) lib/postgrex/protocol.ex:610: Postgrex.Protocol.auth_md5/4
    (postgrex) lib/postgrex/protocol.ex:504: Postgrex.Protocol.handshake/2
    (db_connection) lib/db_connection/connection.ex:135: DBConnection.Connection.connect/2
    (connection) lib/connection.ex:622: Connection.enter_connect/5
    (stdlib) proc_lib.erl:249: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3
    ```

**Solution:**

Your eWallet instance has reached the database server. The database server is expecting a username and password. 
Ensure that:

1. You're not running commands as `sudo`.

2. If your database server requires authentication, you've provided the eWallet with the correct postgres's username and password (e.g. notice this part: your_pg_username:your_pg_password)

    ```bash
    export DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_pg_username:your_pg_password@localhost/ewallet_dev
    export LOCAL_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_pg_username:your_pg_password@localhost/local_ledger_dev
    ```

3. If you prefer to entrust your local connections, your `pg_hba.conf` file should allow trusted connections from localhost, such as the following: 

    ```
    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
    local   all             all                                     trust
    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
    host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
    ```

## API documentation
