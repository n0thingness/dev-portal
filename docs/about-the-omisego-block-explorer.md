## What is a block explorer?
The blockchain is an open and transparent public ledger that contains records of every transaction included into it. Public access to the blockchain ledger supports a decentralized honor system.

A block explorer (or blockchain explorer) is an online blockchain browser that allows you to explore the entire blockchain of the platform you're using. It can be likened to a network analytics tool.

Using a block explorer, you can view all current and past blocks and transactions, and determine the state of the network and the state of your transaction (including its confirmation time). 

Cryptocurrency users rely on block explorers to track their transactions and to view details for the latest blocks in the blockchain. When a new block is discovered, all block explorers should list it the second it's generated.

Block explorers display the details of individual network blocks, but also allow you to search for transaction IDs and wallet addresses so that you can check on specific transactions to your own wallet address. The main page of the block explorer displays a list of 'strange transactions', and lists the latest and largest transactions.

A block explorer is a valuable tool for understanding how miners are generating the cryptocurrency, and how it is distributed.


## OmiseGO Network block explorer
Since a block explorer allows you to inspect a specific blockchain, you'll be able to view data for the OmiseGO Network via OmiseGO's online blockchain browser at http://quest.samrong.omg.network/

The block explorer displays information from the Mainnet or the Testnet.

The table describes the type of data you can view via the OmiseGO Network block explorer:

<!-- These fields are not in v1. Some won't exist on omg block explorer -->
<!-- Genesis block: 	Details of the first block on the blockchain. NOT SURE THIS WILL BE AVAILABLE -->
<!-- Charts and statistics: For determining mempool status, and whether mining difficulty is becoming easier or more difficult. -->
<!-- Mempool status: The status of mempool, displaying the total number of unconfirmed transactions, along with transaction details. Note that Mempool figures may change frequently, and are only an estimate.  -->
<!-- Double spend incidents: A record of the number of double spend transactions performed in the last 10 minutes.  -->
<!-- Orphaned blocks: The number of blocks that were orphaned and not attached to the blockchain.    -->


| Data   | Description   | 
| ---       |  ---  | 
| Block feed    | 	A live feed for recently mined blocks, along with details of the mining pools that discovered the blocks, and data for individual blocks. Note that the block explorer lists a new block as soon as miners discover it and it emerges on the network.   | 
| Transaction feed  | A live feed for transactions in any blocks on the blockchain, including data for individual transactions, such as the largest transaction of the day.
| Details indicating network condition  | Block feed and transaction feed allow you to determine the blockchain's hash rate and transaction growth. The OmiseGO block explorer also displays a color marker to indicate the state of the network, either green or red.  |
| Address information   |  The transaction history of a specific address, allowing you to audit information such as the number of transactions received, and the address balance.   |




## View block and transaction details
To check specific transactions from your own wallet or any other address, input the hash or wallet address in the block explorer search field. 

Each block has a unique URL; clicking on the block's URL displays details about the transactions and size of the block, including: 

* The unique hash of the block.
    > **Note:** *Clicking the hash displays its data, and allows you to toggle between a transaction and the one that came before it, and which gave it its inputs.The hash is difficult to generate and becomes more difficult as time progresses.*

* The size of the block.

* A timestamp for when the block was found.

* Details of the current block reward for every network block distributed to the miners who helped solve its hash.

    > **Note:** *The first transaction of every block is the income earned by the miners. All other transactions are fund transfers generated by users and the associated fees used to broadcast that transaction.*

* Details of transactions belonging to the block.
* A link to previous network blocks, all of which have a unique hash and a set of transactions.

 
<!-- Slava review comment: suggest to remove this part for now. BE is far too imperfect now. Missing many useful things. We are not showing "pending" yet. -->

<!-- ## Send a transaction to the blockchain
The full process for a fund transfer on the blockchain may take around 10-30 minutes.

To send funds, you'll first need to create a transaction:

Use your wallet to create the transaction with your private key.
The transaction is broadcast to the node.
Note: A node is a server that has a full record of transactions on the blockchain. 
Once your transaction reaches the node, it is automatically added to the mempool (the pool of transactions waiting for confirmation).
When other nodes see your transaction, it becomes visible on the block explorer with a status 'Unconfirmed or Pending Transaction'.

Miners now approve the transaction, pick it up from the mempool, and include it in a block.
The block is added to the blockchain, and your funds are automatically transferred to the recipient address.

The transaction status on the block explorer changes to 'Confirmed'. -->


## Transaction status
Typically, when viewing the Block Explorer right after sending money, the transaction status is 'Unconfirmed'. This means your transaction is waiting to be to be approved by miners and included in the blockchain. Once the transaction has enough confirmations, its status changes to 'Successful'.

Transactions on the block explorer will have one of these statuses: 

| Status    | Description   |
| ---       | ---           |
| Successful Transaction    | Transaction has been successfully added to the block. |
| Rejected Transaction      | Transaction fees are too low for miners to add it to the blockchain. The transaction will not appear on the blockchain. In this case, you'll need to resend the funds using regular fees. |

<!-- Pending Transaction (We are not showing "pending" yet.)	Transaction is waiting for miners to approve and to add the transaction to the block. -->
	



## OmiseGO Network Block Explorer GUI

The table provides field descriptions for the OmiseGO Network block explorer:

| Fieldgroup    | Field | Description   |
| ---           | ---   |  ---          |
| Sample Transaction Data   | Transaction   | Unique identifier. A hash for all child chain transactions.   |
|                           | Transferred   | Total amount transferred. Based on input. |
|                           | From          | Input. A maximum of 4 Inputs. Each input has an address and amount. |
|                           | To            | Output. A maximum of 4 outputs. Each output has an address and amount. |
|                           | Metadata      | An additional data field for every transaction. Always an encoded hex value. |
|                           | OMG block height  | OmiseGO Network block height. |
|                           | Ethereum block height | Refer to the Etherscan block content here: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/block/4821393 |
